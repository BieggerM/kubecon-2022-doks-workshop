# KubeCon EU 2022 Workshop 
## GitOps to Automate the Setup, Management and Extension of a Kubernetes Cluster 

### Welcome! 

The goal of this [session](https://kccnceu2022.sched.com/event/yto4/gitops-to-automate-the-setup-management-and-extension-a-k8s-cluster-kim-schlesinger-digitalocean) is for you to experience the power of Infrastructure as Code and GitOps to automate the provisioning, modification, and extension of a Kubernetes cluster.

This workshop is designed for you to pick and choose what you want to learn. Everyone should complete chapters 1 and 5, spinning up and a down a Kubernetes cluster, but you can choose the other chapters you would like to complete. Here is an overview of the material: 

- Required: [Chapter 1 - Create a DigitalOcean Kubernetes Cluster with Terraform](./01-cluster-setup.md)
- Optional: [Chapter 2 - Build a GitOps Pipeline with Flux](./02-flux.md)
- Optional: [Chatper 3 - Encrypt Kubernetes Secrets Using Sealed Secrets](./03-sealed-secrets.md)
- Optional: [Chapter 4 - Make Your Cluster a Universal Control Plane with Crossplane](./04-crossplane.md)
